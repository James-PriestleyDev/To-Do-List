### PP2 Brainstorm

For my PP2 I will be doing a To-Do list webapp.

This To-Do list will allow the user to input and submit their tasks and once submitted
their tasks will show on the webapp in list order. 

The To-Do list will also tally up the users completed and outstanding tasks, showing these
results at the bottom of the page. 

So the user can keep track of how many tasks they have completed and how many they have left to complete. 

### HTML / CSS

The HTML/CSS side to the web page will be basic on a static card in the center of the webapp.
Colour scheme - TBC
Font style - TBC
Favicon image will be an image of a list. 

To-Do list will have an input form with a submit button.
Once a submission is made it'll create a ul list. 
Against each list item will be a 'complete' button which will remove the item from the list.


### JS Functions

I will need a function which takes a user's text input and displays their input to the webapp
the input function will also alert the user when they attempt to submit an empty input box to the webapp. 'Invalid submission'

I will need a function to tally up the users inputs and display this to the webapp
The function will also need to tally up completed/outstanding tasks.

I will also need a function to remove completed tasks from the webapp and alert the user:
'Congratulations for completing a task, You are amazing!'

A function to tally up completed/oustanding tasks and to display this to the webapp
