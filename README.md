### Bugs

Debugged an issue which I created when adding the google-fonts to my css. 
I had fogotten to add a ';' to the end of the input resulting in all my css styling 
to become ignored by the PC.

Debugged another issue when creating responsiveness with my website. I had issues with white-
space inbetween the header and the main content due to a margin I had placed in to fix a previous issue. Reducing the size of the margin-top removed this issue.

Debugged an issue with my images not showing on README.md. Turns out I used {} instead of () for linking the image to the .md - Issue has been resolved using correct ()
